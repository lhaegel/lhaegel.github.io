I am a researcher at the [Institute of Physics of the 2 Infinities](https://www.ip2i.in2p3.fr/?lang=en) of Lyon, France.

My field of research is particle physics, and how the properties of fundamental constituents of matter give us indications about the laws of Nature and the content of the Universe. I focus on studying neutrinos, the most elusive and mysterious of all the fundamental particles.

More details about my research are available on my [publications](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1348388).

I make science permeate beyond the lab with projects at the intersection of [art and science](https://lhaegel.github.io/art/).

For collaborations, internships, theses or postdoctoral positions, please [contact me via e-mail](https://annuaire.in2p3.fr/6470-11492/leila-haegel).
