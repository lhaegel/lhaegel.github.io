The proceeding of the first [African Conference on High-Energy Physics](https://indico.marwan.ma/event/1/) have been published at [Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-88933-2). A beautiful record for this important event, of which I am very proud to have been in the scientific committee.
